# Adding a new system

Adding a new system is easy!

If you are comfortable with opening a pull request on GitHub (requires logging in with GitHub), follow these steps:

1. In the folder `/systems` in the root directory of this project create a new file with the name of your new system.
2. Fill this file with information about your system (see the example file).
3. Create a pull request with the new file to the `master` branch of this repository.

Done !
